I’m a big believer in using books to deepen knowledge of a subject. I also do love videos and find them a great way to initially learn a subject and get up to speed on something quickly, but books fill in the gaps a and ‘real-world’ details that a video can understandably gloss over in an effort to show a ‘happy path’.

The books below are the ones I have found most value from over the years. Some are pretty old but the concepts are still very relevant and explain the topic in a way I haven’t seen bettered. I’ll try give a wide range of topics and hopefully help someone out there. 

## Paid Book Resources

### O’Reilly Learning Safari

I recommend trying out Learning Safari by O’Reilly. It is expensive, but it gives access to almost all books available in the technical world! Try get on thanksgiving Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals.

### Humble Bundle

The humble bundle can sometimes have very good book bundles (O’Reilly) and some middling okay books (Packt). Either way, it can be a quick way to get some decent books for cheap.

### Deals of the Day

Lots of publishers have deals of the day, like Manning, have a google.

## Free Book Resources

### Free Books

Lots of publishers like Packt, Manning, Apress etc also have a small selection of free books which can be worth looking over before buying something, especially in open source areas like Git and Python.

### Packt Free Learning

Packt has it’s place and has a massive selection of books, but the quality can very quite wildly (their Jekyll book was almost nothing to do with Jekyll!), but they do release a free book each day for free. It can be worth checking to see if something decent is available. It adds to your account so it maintains a library for you which is very nice.

## Recommended Books

### Docker In Practice

Simply superb. Real-world all the way and shows you how to use Docker in ways you didn’t even realise, like piping things into it and getting output (say image resizing or turning documents into PDFs for example). 

### Continuous Delivery

Blah

### Linux Quick Fix Notebook - Peter Harrison

The book that really got me to understand Linux and some core concepts like networking, DNS and general system management. The premise is how to use and setup a Linux machine running Fedora Core v1 (yes, v1!) as a home server for websites, samba shares and things like that. It is fairly old, but it really hasn’t aged massively and should still translate if you can do a little self editing while reading. Some topics are a little redundant (no need to struggle with wiki on Linux now) and it is very definitely pre-cloud, so keep that in mind, but for learning how to do it yourself, it is excellent as an explaining book. Highly recommended!
