Here is a list of my must have utilities. Some of these are paid, but I feel are well worth the cash. In going through this I have noticed a few traits I seem to gravitate towards;
 - Multiplatform
I use a Mac at home and use Windows at work. Linux is a hobby OS which I run to keep up to date. So, having one tool to learn (learning new software is hard!) is a massive bonus for me.

 - One off fee
I abhor a monthly fee. It just makes me feel anxious that if i'm not getting value from the software each month if i'm not using it. If so, I need to increase my usage or abandon it, even though I may like it. It just messes with my head. I don't think I use any tool with a monthly fee. I did have gitkraken, Adobe Photography Plan and intellij at one point, but I just feel like i'm on a treadmill at all times. Nope, no fun and too much mental hassle for me. Â£10 a month for Adobe Photography Plan is actually really great value, I can understand that, but it is still too much like jumping on a tiger I can't get off. Some items below are a single fee but require the next year paid for maintenance etc... and i'm fine with that. I'd rather do that than be left empty 

 - Better than open source tools



## Visual Studio Code - $FREE

The gorilla of IDEs at the moment. Free, multi-platform and an all-in-one coding platform. Just learn this now and enjoy.


## Beyond Compare - http://scootersoftware.com/ - $60

Multiplatform 

## Snagit

Yeah, you can get greenshot for free, and use the windows snipping tool, but if you do any kind of documentation at all then this makes it 10 times easier. It keeps a 'library' of past screenshots and allows easy adding of arrows and annotations, automatically add a black border on capture etc... And, for simple video captures for a quick walkthrough of something, it's super effective. I'm kind of surprised nothing else like it exists for free. It will save you time in spades.

## Clipboard Keeper

Tired of having to go back to something you had already put on the clipboard and retrieving it? Get this. Keeps the last hundreds of text copy/pastes and is even searchable. Very handy when you need it.

## Mobaxterm

Use linux but are working on windows? Get this. 

## Remote Desktop Manager Free

Organise all your remote desktop sessions

## Sublime Text

I used notepad++ for a long time. But, sublime text combines the benefits of VS Code style setup with a super fast start time. I can still get by with notepad++ but i'm trying to use sublime text more as it is multiplatform (seeing a theme here?) which means learning (and paying for it) is a worthwhile investment to me.

## Sublime Merge 

Again, multiplatform, fast load and a one-off price. 

## VMWare Workstation and Fusion
